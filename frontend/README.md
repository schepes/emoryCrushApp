## AWS Backend Architecture

The backend services are entirely built on AWS technologies. For authentication, we are using AWS Cognito. Data storage is handled by DynamoDB, and serverless functions are executed with AWS Lambda. [Learn More](AWS-Architecture.md)

## Data Retention and Privacy

We take data privacy seriously. Upon first use, the app will ask for permission to access the contact list to assist in the matchmaking feature. [Learn More](Privacy-Policy.md)

## Analytics

We utilize AWS Kinesis Streams and Amazon QuickSight to collect and visualize real-time user interactions for better insights and continuous improvement.
